You will derive a new pet, class TabbyCat, from Pet.\n","\n","// Your class should *derive publicly* from class Pet.  In its *constructor*\n","// it should invoke the four initialization subroutines of the base class;\n","// set_initial_weight, set_ideal_adult_weight, set_age_of_adulthood,\n","// and set_metabolic_rate.
